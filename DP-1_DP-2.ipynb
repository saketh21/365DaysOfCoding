    "<b>Problem Statement</b>: Given two strings s1 and s2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common Subsequence, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Example:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "s1 = aggtab\n",
    "s2 = gxtxayb\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Constraints:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input Strings consist of lowercase letters only\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Some Notes:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a Subsequence?\n",
    "Subsequence of a string is a NEW String generated from the ORIGINAL String with some(can be none) characters deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\n",

    "<b>Questions I had:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How is it a Dynamic Programming Problem? How do I even know? - May be by solving more problems :P\n",
    "2. So, first thing that comes to mind here is to look for the first common letter and next common letter and so on. Does my mind's pattern recognition actually work? What is the proof? What if there is some sequence that I am not able to see through my eyes? - May be I need to code.\n",
    "3. Ok, So someone told me to use Dynamic Programming. Now what? I need to decompose. So, what's the easiest sub problem that I can solve? - Just think I have only one character in the string.\n",
    "4. So now, someone again told me, just look at the last character, if it matches you have a common subsequence of length 1. Oh.. that's an easy subproblem. Wait, that's it? Just look at the last character, when it matches chop if off and look at the last character of the remaining substring? what if it doesn't match? \n",
    "5. Ok, now what? :-( It doesn't match. What to do- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1fUKbgyAk4 gives a good explanation\n",
